# Healthcare Data Breach Analysis & Predictive Modeling

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes healthcare data breaches reported to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. It explores breach patterns, financial impact, and builds a predictive model to estimate potential loss based on breach characteristics.

## 📊 Data Sources
- [HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf) – U.S. Department of Health & Human Services
- [Ponemon Institute](http://www.ponemon.org/) – Cost of a Data Breach Report
- [Fortified Health Security](https://fortifiedhealthsecurity.com/) – Mid-Year Cybersecurity Report
- [HIPAA Journal](https://www.hipaajournal.com) – Breach trends and statistics

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Regression modeling (scikit-learn)
- Data cleaning and enrichment

## 📈 Key Insights
- Ransomware is the most disruptive attack category.
- Breach size strongly predicts financial loss.
- Business associates are linked to large-scale incidents.

## 🔮 Predictive Modeling
A regression model was built to estimate financial loss based on breach size and attack category. Future work may include classification models to predict disruption likelihood.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run cells sequentially to load data, clean it, and generate visualizations.
4. Review the regression model output and insights.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Expand predictive modeling to include classification.
- Explore time-series trends and breach recurrence.
- Integrate external threat intelligence feeds.
